Background:
Management hasgive the team assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, write a report that summarizes the analysis that helps prepare  for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
  SQL queries were written to generate a list of retiring employees by title.
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
  More SQL were written to create a list of employees the are elibible to be mentees
Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis 

Results:
There are more than 90,000 Pewett-Hackard employees who are eligible for retirement.  On the other hand, there are only 1549 employees eligible for the mentee program.
This is a massive loss of talent, knowledge, and experience.
Something needs to be done to mitigate these problems...can the company incentivze retiring employees to stay (perhaps in a consulting role).  We also need to run queries that narrows the age range to increase the potential pool of mentees.
